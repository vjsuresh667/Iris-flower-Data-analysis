You experimented with several values for K (the number of neighbors), and the results were surprisingly consistent: the model achieved an impressive 93.33% accuracy across all tested K values (1,3,5,7,9,11).

Choosing the Best K
While K=1 was technically just as accurate, your choice of K=5 is excellent. Why? A slightly larger K makes the model more stable and less prone to being influenced by a single noisy data point (an "outlier"). You found the sweet spot: high accuracy and stability!

Where the Model Got Tricked (The Confusion Matrix)
Your model was nearly perfect, with its performance breakdown showing the following:

Species	Correctly Classified	Misclassified
Iris-setosa	15 out of 15	0
Iris-versicolor	15 out of 15	0
Iris-virginica	12 out of 15	3

The confusion matrix tells the real story:

The model had zero trouble identifying Iris-setosa and Iris-versicolor. They are very distinct!

The only errors occurred when classifying Iris-virginica. The model mistook 3 Iris-virginica flowers for Iris-versicolor. This common confusion happens because these two species' characteristics (especially petal size) overlap slightly in the real world.
